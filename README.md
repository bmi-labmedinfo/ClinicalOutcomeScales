# ClinicalOutcomeScales

This repo contains an Ontology designed to standardize the use and selection of clinical scales to compre-hensively assess patient status. The ontology incorporates key elements such as measurement goals, information needs, specific scales, and factors like healthcare professionals, devices, and clinical conditions. We present the ontology within the context of the Fit4MedRob initiative, which seeks to improve the implementation of robotics-assisted rehabilitation in clinical practice.
